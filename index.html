            <p>I joined IBA Wealth Management Ltd in 2020 as a mortgage adviser. Prior to this, I spent 12 years working as a dispenser, then a store manager at Boots in London before moving to Norfolk to run my own Newsagents business. In 2008, I started with my Investment Property Portfolio and to date I have eight properties. I built my property portfolio from scratch and used this experience to earn a Certificate in Mortgage Advice and Practice from London Institute of Banking and Finance. Having truly enjoyed my journey in Real Estate investment and the financial freedom I've gained from it, I joined IBA Wealth Management Ltd to help others on their own journey.
            
            Whether you are in need of guidance in finding the right property for you, completing your mortgage - I am here to help! Available Monday to Saturday, 9am to 9pm, but can also be available on Sundays for those with a busier lifestyle!

            When I am not searching for my next property, I enjoy cooking food from all over the world and playing badminton.
